## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Unit, Inc. is an open-source initiative by us. We open-source libraries, the main app and helpers that we use internally for our commercial projects. We hope to enable more people to improve the roadmap for their fitnes journey :rocket: 

💳 [Sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/unit) if you want the open-sourcing to go faster & better :D

🌈 Get involved by joining our [discord](https://discord.gg/), following our [twitter](https://twitter.com/) or opening issues and pull requests on our repositories here (: 

👩‍💻 You can find our website here: ... - at the moment most of the things are going on discord though

🍿 You can download the Unit App via the [Google Play Store]() and [Apple App Store]().

🧙 Keep in mind that the site is still in development and not finished yet.

🤝 You can contribute by translating the mobile application to more languages [here]().
